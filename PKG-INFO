Description: m3u8downloader
        ============================
        
        m3u8downloader is a tool to download video at a m3u8 link. `HTTP Live
        Streaming (HLS)`_ is becoming popular. m3u8 playlist is used by HLS to serve
        video fragments of different quality to different clients. This tool supports
        HLS master playlist and media playlist. If master playlist is given, it
        selects the highest resolution automatically. HLS fragment encryption is
        supported. Resume from partial download is supported, just rerun the same
        command to continue.
        
        ffmpeg is used to convert the downloaded fragments into final mp4 video file.

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        This command line tool doesn't have extra documents.
        
        Limitations
        -------------
        
        This tool only parses minimum m3u8 extensions for selecting media playlist
        from master playlist, downloading key and fragments from media playlist. If a
        m3u8 file doesn't download correctly, it's probably some new extension was
        added to the HLS spec which this tool isn't aware of.
